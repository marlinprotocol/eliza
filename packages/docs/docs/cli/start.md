# Start Command

The `start` command launches an ElizaOS project or agent in production mode. It initializes the agent runtime, loads plugins, connects to services, and starts handling interactions.

## Usage

```bash
npx @elizaos/cli start [options]
```

## Options

| Option               | Description                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-p, --port <port>`  | Port to listen on (default: 3000)                                    |
| `-c, --configure`    | Reconfigure services and AI models (skips using saved configuration) |
| `--character <path>` | Path or URL to character file to use instead of default              |
| `--build`            | Build the project before starting                                    |

## Production Features

When you run `start`, ElizaOS provides production-ready features:

1. **Optimized Performance**: Runs with production optimizations
2. **Stable Configuration**: Uses saved configuration by default
3. **Service Management**: Handles service connections and disconnections
4. **Error Recovery**: Automatic recovery from transient errors
5. **Resource Management**: Efficient resource allocation and cleanup

## What Happens During Startup

When you run the `start` command, ElizaOS:

1. Detects whether you're in a project or plugin directory
2. Loads and validates the configuration
3. Initializes the database system
4. Loads required plugins
5. Starts any configured services
6. Processes knowledge files if present
7. Starts the HTTP API server
8. Initializes agent runtimes
9. Begins listening for messages and events

For development features and hot reloading, see the [Dev Command](./dev.md).

## Project Detection

ElizaOS automatically detects projects in the current directory by looking for:

1. A `package.json` with an `eliza.type` field set to `project`
2. A main entry point that exports a project configuration with agents
3. Other project indicators in the package metadata

## Environment Variables

The `start` command will look for an `.env` file in the project directory and load environment variables from it. You can also set environment variables directly:

```bash
# Set environment variables directly
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key npx @elizaos/cli start
```

For detailed information about environment configuration, see the [Environment Command](./env.md).

## Examples

### Basic startup

```bash
cd my-agent-project
npx @elizaos/cli start
```

### Starting with configuration

```bash
npx @elizaos/cli start --configure
```

### Starting with a custom port

```bash
npx @elizaos/cli start --port 8080
```

### Starting with a custom character

```bash
npx @elizaos/cli start --character path/to/character.json
```

## Building Before Starting

To build your project before starting it:

```bash
npx @elizaos/cli start --build
```

This will compile your TypeScript files and prepare the project for execution.
